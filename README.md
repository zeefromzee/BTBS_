## GHZ State Visualization Example

The GHZ state is a fundamental example of quantum entanglement that involves multiple qubits. For a three-qubit system, the GHZ state can be represented as follows:

\[ |GHZ⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|000⟩ + |111⟩) \]

In this example, we showcase how to visualize the GHZ state using the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere provides an intuitive geometrical depiction of quantum states, allowing us to understand the superposition and entangled nature of the qubits.

This visualization illustrates the correlations between the qubits and can be helpful for understanding quantum computations and algorithms that utilize entangled states.
